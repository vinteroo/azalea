        <p>Hello my dear, Azalea</p>
      
<p>I'm at a loss for words on how to begin this, but I thought it would be a pleasant surprise to do something unique for you. I'm somewhat embarrassed to confess how much time I've spent on this, but I'm quite pleased with myself (I must admit, TikTok was a great help in getting the basic coding done for this, I'm not that genius after all.) I'm crossing my fingers that this works as planned. I apologize in advance for the length of this, but I hope you find joy in it.</p>

<p>You are the most extraordinary individual I have ever encountered. You are the first person who has genuinely made me feel secure, cherished, and overjoyed. You are the most giving, remarkable, humorous, caring, affectionate, and kindest man I've ever known. From the moment our paths crossed, I sensed that you were going to hold a special place in my life. I can't explain how I knew, but something within me told me that you were going to significantly influence my life. I have never been affected by anyone the way you have affected me. You have truly unveiled a side of me that I didn't know existed. You bring me immense happiness, darling. Words can't express how much. You've helped me recognize my self-worth and shown me the love that I truly deserve.</p>

<p>You will never comprehend how much I appreciate you. Everything you do for me is recognized and appreciated. I can't even begin to express how absolutely perfect you are. Everything about you amazes me. I have never met someone as breathtaking as you. I genuinely can't understand how I was lucky enough to win your heart. I'm in awe of you. My mind can't grasp how someone can be so perfect.</p>

<p>I want you to always remember how proud I am of you. Remember how far you've come and how resilient you are. You should be immensely proud of yourself for still standing, still smiling, and for never giving up. I know that life can be tough at times, but I want you to know that you have the strength to overcome any challenge that comes your way. Your past experiences have made you stronger, my love. You never have to face anything alone anymore. I will always be there for you, no matter what life throws at us. You're incredible, and as long as I'm here, you'll never be alone. </p>

<p>You have shown me a love that is pure and unconditional, a love that knows no bounds. You have an amazing ability to make me feel like I'm the only one that matters to you. In your presence, I am enveloped by a profound sense of gratitude and compassion, and time seems to freeze when I'm with you. Your unwavering support and faith in me have given me the courage to pursue the paths I want in life, and I can't thank you enough for being the push I needed. Just being with you has the power to brighten even the darkest days, and your infectious laughter always brings a smile to my face. In your arms, I find comfort and peace, knowing that I am cherished, loved, and accepted for who I am. With you by my side, I feel an overwhelming sense of safety and love that I cherish beyond words.</p>

<p>I am endlessly proud of the person you are. Your kindness and compassion shine through in everything you do, touching the lives of those lucky enough to cross your path. Your genuine concern for others and your selfless acts of generosity inspire me to be a better person every day. Luke, you truly embody the essence of goodness, and I am so grateful to witness firsthand the impact you have on so many people's lives. I feel privileged to have someone like you in my life. Your dedication and hardworking nature are truly commendable. Watching you conquer challenges, chase your dreams, and become the person you've always aspired to be fills me with pride and joy. Your dedication and determination inspire me each day, and I'm honored to witness that journey unfold firsthand.
</p>
<p>
As I look forward to the future we are set to share, I am excited about all the possibilities that lie ahead. I look forward to loving you, getting a little puppy together, getting married, starting our own family, growing old together, and overall, just experiencing life with the person who brings me the most happiness. For the first time in my life, I can see a future. I wake up in the morning feeling incredibly grateful because I know you'll be there.</p>

<p>
I hope you've enjoyed this. Words can't begin to describe how much I love you.
</p>
        <p>Je t'aime pour toujours et toujours, mon amour.
